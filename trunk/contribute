We really need a user manual.<br/>
vQModerator has grown so much, and has accumulated quite a lot of (un-documented) functions and uses.<br/>
Everything is mentioned in the changelog, but there's no real user manual.<br/>
I'm a pretty busy man, and maintaining about 10 contributions (next to my day-job) is a lot of work.<br/>
Please help the community out, and contribute to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/vqmoderator/w/list" target="_blank">vQModerator GoogleCode Wiki</a>.<br/>
If you don't have (or want) a google account, you can also send your contribution using the form below.<br/><br/>
Also, we always need translations for vQModerator.<br/>
That's why the text area below is pre-filled with the language file.<br/>
If you speak a language that is not yet supported, please edit the language file below, and press "Contribute!"<br/>
* This requires that the email settings for this store are working!<br/>
